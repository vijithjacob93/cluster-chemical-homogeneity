# cluster-chemical-homogeneity
This repository consists of the code used for a project studying the chemical homogeneity of open clusters in the Milky Way. It consists of a pipeline that finds cluster members using stellar kinematics for a large number of open clusters, and a novel method to re-derive abundance uncertainties for stars.
